*Particle "You're Muted" detector using microphone and Edge Impulse Edge ML*

Full instructions can be found at [Automatic Unmuting: Unlocking the Power of Edge Machine Learning](https://www.particle.io/makemagazine2023/) as featured in [Make: Magazine Volume 87](https://www.makershed.com/collections/make-magazine/products/make-magazine-volume-87-print).

This detector is trained to recognize the phrase "You're muted" and generate a keystroke to unmute your conference call session. 

## Wiring the microphone

You will need the following hardware:

- PDM digital microphone
- Photon 2 (included with the Edge ML Kit)
- Jumper wires

You can also purchase the PDM microphone from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3492). 

The [Edge ML Kit](https://docs.particle.io/reference/datasheets/accessories/edge-ml-kit/) available on the [Particle retail store](https://store.particle.io/collections/wifi/products/photon-2-edge-ml-kit) also includes all of the necessary parts.


The connections on the breakout are:

| Breakout | Color | Connect To | Details |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| 3V | Red | 3V3 | 3.3V power |
| GND | Black | GND | Ground |
| SEL | | NC | Typically leave unconnected, left/right select |
| CLK | Blue | A0 | PDM Clock |
| DAT | Green | A1 | PDM Data |

The pinout for the Photon 2 can be found on its [datasheet](https://docs.particle.io/reference/datasheets/wi-fi/photon-2-datasheet/#pin-markings).

Other PDM microphones should be compatible, but the pinouts may vary. Note that PDM is different than PWM and I2S, which are different and incompatible sound interfaces.

## Configure conference service

These instructions are for Zoom, however all services support configuration of a keystroke for muting and unmuting in a similar fashion.

Open the Settings in Zoom. Then select Keyboard Shortcuts. Find **Mute/Unmute my Audio**. Note the key sequence, and you will probably want to check the box for Enable Global Shortcut. The default is typically Command-Shift-A on the Mac and Alt-A on Windows.

![Keyboard shortcuts](images/keyboard-shortcuts.png)

If using a global shortcut, on the Mac, you may be asked to enable accessibility features. In the Control Panel, it's in Privacy & Security, Accessibility, and make sure the slider is set to on for zoom.

The first time you connect the Photon 2 running this firmware on the Mac, you may be prompted to select the keyboard type. Select ANSI.

## Automatic setup

Plug your Photon 2 module into your computer - Linux/Mac/Windows are all supported. Boot up the Chrome web browser on your computer and navigate over to https://particle.io/makemagazine2023.

This web page will walk you through programming the Photon 2 directly from within your browser environment, connecting over WebUSB. Note, you will be prompted to set-up a Particle account if you want to benefit from the platform features (such as over the air programming), but itâ€™s not required for the initial flashing of your Photon 2.

## Manual setup

### Install Particle Workbench

If you have not already done so, install [Particle Workbench](https://docs.particle.io/workbench/), the integrated development for Particle devices for Windows, Linux, and Mac.

For a new install be sure to log into your Particle account. From the command palette (Ctrl-Shift-P on Windows and Linux or Cmd-Shift-P on Mac). Select **Particle: Login**.

### Running pre-built demos

The easiest way to get started is to download [this repository](https://github.com/particle-iot/make-magazine-muted-demo) from Github, using your favorite Github client or downloading and extracting the .zip file.

- Open `make-magazine-muted-demo` using the **File > Open Folder...** option in Particle Workbench (VS Code).
- Open a command line prompt from the command palette (Ctrl-Shift-P on Windows and Linux or Cmd-Shift-P on Mac). Select **Particle: Launch CLI**.
- Flash the prebuilt binary to your device. 

For Windows or Linux (Alt-A is the mute key):

```
particle flash MyPhoton firmware-win.bin
```

For Mac (Command-Shift-A is the mute key):

```
particle flash MyPhoton firmware-mac.bin
```

Replace "MyPhoton" with the name of your device. If you aren't sure what you named it, use `particle list`.


### Building the software

To build your own binary:

- Use **Particle: Configure Project For Device** and select **deviceOS@5.5.0** and **P2**. The P2 option is also used for the Photon 2. Device OS 5.4.1 or later is required for this demo.
- In src/make-magazine-muted-demo.cpp, you'll need to configure the keyboard shortcut in the function`generateKeystrokes()` near the top of the file.

```cpp
void generateKeystrokes() 
{
    Log.info("Sending key");
    
    // Keyboard.click(KEY_A, MOD_LEFT_COMMAND | MOD_LSHIFT); // Mac
    Keyboard.click(KEY_A, MOD_LALT); // Windows                
}
```

- Use **Particle: Cloud Flash** to compile and flash the code to your device.
