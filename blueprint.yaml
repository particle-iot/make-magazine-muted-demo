  This application leverages the Photon 2 and Edge Impulse Machine Learning to detect the phrase "You're muted" during conference calls and automatically trigger an unmute keystroke over USB.

  - Connects to a PDM microphone to capture audio signals
  - Recognizes phrases using Edge Impulse-trained machine learning model
  - Generates a keystroke sequence for unmuting the user's microphone on video calls
  - Compatible with common virtual meeting software like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams
  - Provides both pre-built and custom build options, allowing users to easily deploy or further customize keystrokes
  - Photon 2 integrates with Particle's cloud platform, enabling over-the-air (OTA) updates and monitoring capabilities for connected devices

  Full instructions and setup details are available on the Particle website, as featured in Make Magazine 2023.
